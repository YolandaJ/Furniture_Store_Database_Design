# Furniture_Store_Database_Design
In this project, we designed a database system for a furniture store.
First we conducted a research about a furniture store and collected data requirements,such as information about the main components of the system, how the system works, howdifferent entities interact with each other etc.
Then we designed a system as practical as possible, which means, assumptions we made should comply well with real world situations. For details about how the system is designed and implemented, please open project report file.
